# Upgrade from 3.x to 4.0
Version 4 only removes compatibility for Symfony 2, Symfony 3 and Symfony <= 4.3. No interfaces or services changed.
Please notice that the support for [Contentful Activator](https://packagist.org/packages/flagception/contentful-activator) was dropped.

Have fun with Symfony 5 :-)
